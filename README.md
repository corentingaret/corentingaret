### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Corentin, I recently graduated from a business school and decided to acquire skills in data science.
I took part of Le Wagon batch #552 in Paris, ending the bootcamp with a project on Speech Sentimental Recognition.
I am looking to collaborate (and learn!) on data analysis & data science projects.

I am open to join a data team in a tech company, in Europe preferably.
To reach me, don't hesitate to send me an email at garetcorentin@gmail.com !
